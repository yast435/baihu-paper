# Baihu Paper

This repository tracks the LaTeX draft and supporting materials for the Baihu dataset paper.

## Working title

**Baihu: A Billion-Frame Multi-Embodiment Robot Manipulation Dataset for Embodied Foundation Models**

## Current paper direction

The current paper positions Baihu as a large-scale, fully human-teleoperated, LeRobot v2.1-standardized, multi-platform robot manipulation dataset for robot foundation-model adaptation, offline zero-shot evaluation, and event-aware robot learning. The draft emphasizes two complementary dataset strengths: (1) large-scale dense trajectories for adapting pretrained robot foundation models and improving offline zero-shot generalization, and (2) event/keyframe-level temporal annotations for keyframe-aware and goal-oriented learning.

The draft emphasizes:

- billion-frame robot data for foundation-model adaptation;
- fully human-teleoperated trajectories collected on physical robot platforms;
- multi-platform robot manipulation data coverage;
- task, scenario, skill, robot-category, end-effector, and camera-configuration characterization;
- event- and keyframe-level temporal annotations that capture task progress and semantic milestones beyond gripper or dexterous-hand state changes;
- HDF5-to-LeRobot v2.1 data standardization;
- offline open-loop zero-shot benchmark evaluation with GR00T N1.6;
- reserved real-world evaluation protocol for event-guided value learning.

## Main LaTeX build entry

The current paper draft should be built from:

```text
paper/main.tex
```

`main.tex` imports the paper body from the modular `body_*.tex` files and uses a CVPR-compatible layout: 10 pt Times-style font, two-column letter-paper formatting, CVPR-like margins, compact section spacing, CVPR-style captions, and numeric compressed citations. The main bibliography appears before the appendix. The task-level benchmark table remains in the appendix and is switched to a single-column supplementary-style section because the table is too wide for CVPR's two-column body layout.

By default, `main.tex` uses review mode:

```tex
\usepackage[review]{cvpr}
```

For an internal non-anonymous or camera-ready-style draft with page numbers, change this line to:

```tex
\usepackage[pagenumbers]{cvpr}
```

## Important open issues

The final paper should still verify or refine:

1. final platform naming and hardware-description consistency;
2. dataset split definitions and release/access policy;
3. data quality control rules and filtering statistics;
4. formal citations and BibTeX entries for related datasets and model/tooling dependencies;
5. final figure/table captions and target submission formatting;
6. completed closed-loop, held-out-platform, data-scaling, or event-guided real-world rollout experiments.
