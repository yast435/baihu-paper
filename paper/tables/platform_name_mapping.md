## Naming convention

- Use English platform names in paper text, figures, and tables.
- Keep Baihu embodiment tags in monospace when referring to dataset metadata, for example `qinlongros1` or `genie1`.
- Keep original Chinese task names in task-level benchmark tables unless a separate English task translation table is added.
